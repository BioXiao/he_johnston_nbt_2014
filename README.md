# README

This repository contains the analysis code for our Nature Biotechnology manuscript: [ChIP-nexus enables improved detection of *in vivo* transcription factor binding footprints](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3121).

If you are interested in running this code to reproduce our analysis, we recommend you use our pre-configured Amazon Machine Image (AMI). The image has appropriate versions of all required software and includes the raw and processed data files. You can find more information about the AMI at [http://research.stowers.org/zeitlingerlab/data](http://research.stowers.org/zeitlingerlab/data).

The setup instructions used to configure the AMI are also available in this repository:
